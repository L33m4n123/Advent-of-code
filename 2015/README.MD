# Advent of Code 2015  
  
This is me participating in the Advent of Code 2015  
however I did up to day 12 already once but I will redo it for this  
repository. And will do it not just in java as I see it as a huge  
opportunity to get back into programming and "unrust" myself.

I will also code all of the "puzzles" in dfferent languages
